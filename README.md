This project investigates the relationship between climate policies of countries around the world and their carbon emissions. We used climate policy data gathered from 1927 to present day and used carbon emissions data from 1970 to 2018 to carry out our analysis. Through exploration of the data and carrying out regression analysis, we found that climate policies had little effect in lowering global carbon emissions significantly and in many cases our regression model predicted an increase in emissions for many of the different types of climate policies that were given in our dataset.
